            <p>I'd like to make a shout out to sidewalks, for keeping me off the streets. I'm not saying I'm going to suck at homeschooling my kids but my daughter just asked 'Dad, what's a synonym?' And I replied, 'It's a spice.' What did the bra say to the hat? You go on a head, I gotta give these two a lift. What's red and smells like white paint? Red Paint. What do you call a lost wolf? A Where-wolf. Due to quarantine, I'll only be telling inside jokes.</p>
            <p>What did the bra say to the hat? You go on a head, I gotta give these two a lift. How do you make hold water? You boil the hell out of it.

What did the red light say to the green light? Look awayyyyy I'm changing.</p>
            <p>What do you call a lost wolf? A Where-wolf. What's red and smells like white paint? Red Paint. Why do crabs never give to charity? Because they're shellfish.

            <p>Crochet is not a hobby, it's a post apocalyptic survival skill. Today's forecast: 100% chance of crocheting. My crochet time is sometimes for your safety. Remember that. My problem is not that I buy too much yarn.... it's that I shop faster than I crochet! Yarn is cheaper than therapy. I do not run from my problems. I sit on the couch, crochet, and ignore them like a normal adult. I crochet because life is more fun when you turn string into beautiful things.</p>

            <p>Yes I like to Crochet, and no I'm not old. I crochet because punching people is frowned upon. I can make anything with a hook and yarn. What's your superpower? It's better to have hooked and frogged than to never have hooked at all. Hookers do it with one hand. Crocheting keeps me from unraveling. Crochet is my happy place. It started out as a harmless hobby.... I had no idea it would come to this.</p>
                
            <p>In my perfect world, yarn is free and crocheting makes you thin. Maybe yarn is addicted to me! Ever though of THAT? Crochet is my happy place. It started out as a harmless hobby.... I had no idea it would come to this. I can make anything with a hook and yarn. What's your superpower? I do not run from my problems. I sit on the couch, crochet, and ignore them like a normal adult. I crochet because life is more fun when you turn string into beautiful things.</p>
